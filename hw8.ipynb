Previously we used `DummyClassifier` or `DummyRegressor` as a baseline. This time, we'll do something else as a baseline: we'll assume the price stays the same from this week to next week. So, we'll set our prediction of \"AveragePriceNextWeek\" exactly equal to \"AveragePrice\", assuming no change. That is kind of like saying, \"If it's raining today then I'm guessing it will be raining tomorrow\". This simplistic approach will not get a great score but it's a good starting point for reference.

For instance, a patient with a chronic condition might have frequent visits during flare-ups (daily or weekly measurements) but then go months between measurements when their condition stabilizes. These healthcare visits, lab tests, vital sign measurements, and medication adjustments naturally create time series data with highly irregular time intervals."

    "#### 1. Parameters in LogisticRegression for a four-class problem:\n",
    "For a four-class classification problem with 10 features using sklearn's LogisticRegression(), the model will learn using the \"one-vs-rest\" scheme by default (unless multinomial is specified).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the model will have:\n",

    "Neural networks being like pipelines with sequential transformations is particularly useful for transfer learning because we can leverage the intermediate representations (feature transformations) learned by earlier layers of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In transfer learning, we take a pre-trained network that has already learned hierarchical features (like edges, textures, and complex shapes in image recognition tasks) and reuse those layers. We only need to retrain or fine-tune the later layers to adapt to our specific task. This is analogous to keeping the first transformations in a pipeline while replacing the final estimator. Since the early transformations in neural networks tend to learn general features that apply across many vision tasks, we can benefit from knowledge transfer without training the entire network from scratch on our limited dataset.\n",

    "1. The small dataset (just ~20 images per faculty member) is insufficient to train a deep CNN from scratch without overfitting, but transfer learning leverages knowledge from models pre-trained on millions of images\n",
    "2. I would freeze most of the pre-trained layers and only fine-tune the final few layers to adapt to this specific task of faculty recognition\n",

    "#### 1. Problem with standard supervised learning for customer churn:\n",
    "The fundamental problem with simply labeling customers as \"churned\" or \"not churned\" and using standard supervised learning is that it ignores the time dimension and creates censoring bias. Customers labeled as \"not churned\" are a mix of two groups: those who will never churn and those who simply haven't churned yet but will in the future. This creates an incorrect training signal because many \"not churned\" customers are actually future churners whose outcomes are censored (unknown) at the time of analysis. Standard classification can't account for this partial information, leading to biased models that underestimate churn risk for newer customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Customer A (new) vs. Customer B (1 year):\n",
    "Customer A who just joined last week will probably leave the service first. This follows the common pattern in customer behavior known as \"early churn\" or the \"infant mortality effect.\" New customers typically have the highest risk of churning early in their lifecycle for several reasons:\n",
    "- They haven't developed loyalty or habits around the service\n",
    "- They may be in a trial period or evaluating if the service meets their needs\n",
    "- They haven't made a significant time investment in learning/using the service\n",
    "- They haven't integrated the service into their daily routines\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival curves for many subscription services typically show a steep initial drop (high hazard rate in early periods) followed by flattening (lower hazard rate for established customers), indicating that customers who survive the initial period are more likely to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Interpretation of a flat survival function:\n",
    "If a customer's survival function is almost flat during a certain period, it indicates that the hazard rate (instantaneous risk of churning) is very low during this time. In practical terms, this means the customer has an extremely small probability of churning during this particular period.\n",
    "For business purposes, this could indicate:\n",
    "- A period of customer stability where the service is meeting their needs well\n",
    "- A potential \"safe zone\" after customers have integrated the service into their routines\n",
    "- A time when intervention or marketing efforts might be unnecessary as retention is naturally high\n",
    "- A possible contractual lock-in period where customers face barriers to leaving\n",
    "\n",
    "Such flat periods in survival functions help businesses identify when customers transition from high-risk to low-risk states, informing when to invest in retention efforts versus when to focus resources elsewhere."
